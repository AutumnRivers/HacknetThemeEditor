2. Unzip the file
3. ~~Place all DLLs in the `/global` folder to Hacknet's global plug-in directory. (`<HacknetInstall>/BepInEx/plugins`)~~ As of 1.0.1, all files go in the global plugins directory.

# "Gotchas"
* No editing AlienwareFX colors - you'll have to do that manually
* Due to a bug with text input, the theme file name will always be the current unix time in seconds. You can manually rename the file after you export it
